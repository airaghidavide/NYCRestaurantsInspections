# NYCRestaurantsInspections
Second assignment related to the module of Big Data analytics of the master.

The basic idea is for restaurants to be inspected at least once a year by the state. Based on the inspection, the restaurants will be given a letter grade that represents how sanitary the restaurant enviornment is. The highest grade ('A') is earned if the restaurant is clean, up to code, and free of violations, a 'B' means that the restaurant is clean, but has some minor issues that needs to be fixed and a 'C' means the restaurant shouldn't be open.
